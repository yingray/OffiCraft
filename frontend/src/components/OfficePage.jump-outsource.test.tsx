// T-661b regression: 跳到原訊息 for a card whose sender is an OUTSOURCE worker.
//
// The reply card / worker chat rides the SAME chatId hash slot as a member chat
// (#office/chat/<ow-id>/msg/<msgId>). An outsource worker is NEVER in the 正職
// roster, and once released (task closed) it also drops off the LIVE outsource
// list. When BOTH lookups miss, OfficePage used to fall the chat pane back to
// roster[0] — the first 正職 member (Mira) — so 跳到原訊息 on an outsource
// sender's card silently opened Mira's chat room instead of the origin
// conversation. The fix renders the ORIGINAL conversation read-only under an
// honest "已釋出" identity (chat history is keyed by peer id, so it is still
// reachable), never roster[0]; the same path covers a removed 正職 member.
//
// Rendered through OfficePage so the hash → peer-resolution → ChatArea chain is
// the REAL wiring (the post-jump state the RepliesPage jump button produces).
