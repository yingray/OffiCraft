// The presence NARROWING seam (T-59d6) — one contract, both member and worker
// paths.
//
// WHY this file exists: every presence surface downstream is exhaustive over the
// five-state union (`presenceVisual`'s no-default switch). The wire, however,
// types `presence` as a bare `string` (frozen spec), so a word this build does
// not recognise — an older/newer server, a typo, a state added backend-first —
// can only be caught HERE. If it leaks past this seam it falls off that switch
// and renders `class="lifecycle-dot lifecycle-dot--undefined"`: a dot with no
// colour AND no accessible name on a `role="img"` element. That is worse than
// wrong, it is invisible: nothing else in the app would go red.
//
// So the assertions below are deliberately on BOTH channels — the colour class
// and the accessible name — and the member path is asserted through a REAL
// render of the shared PresenceBadge, not just the mapper's return value.
