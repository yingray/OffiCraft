// api/http.ts — the real-backend adapter.
//
// Programs against the SAME frozen contract (spec/openapi.json) and maps every
// wire DTO through the SAME mappers the mock uses, so index.ts can swap mock↔http
// with zero UI changes.
//
// Every JSON call rides the schema-typed openapi-fetch client (api/client.ts):
// method + path + params + body are checked against generated/schema.ts, so a
// BE verb/path/query rename is a tsc error (ci.sh gate 10a), not a runtime 405.
// The client middleware owns the cross-cutting auth story — owner JWT as
// `Authorization: Bearer` on every request (gated routes are deny-by-default),
// 401 → clear token + oc-auth-expired — and throws an ApiError (api/errors.ts)
// on every non-2xx, carrying `.status`/`.code`/`.serverMessage` off the unified
// error envelope `{"error":{"code","message"}}` (the contract callers branch
// on, e.g. deleteRole's 409 via isHttpStatus).
//
// PERMANENTLY HAND-WRITTEN (schema-external by nature, never migrated):
//   - subscribeEvents (bottom) — an EventSource, not a fetch; the owner JWT
//     rides as `?token=` because EventSource cannot set headers.
//   - authedAttachmentUrl — a `?token=` URL rewrite for bare <img>/<a>, not a
//     network call at all.
//   - auth.ts login() — a public endpoint (no Authorization) whose job is the
//     setToken side effect; routing it through the authed client buys nothing.
// The `?token=` query fallback is OUTSIDE the OpenAPI contract (the schema has
// no token query param) — it is pinned only by service/auth.py + these comments.

// ── shared SSE downlink (connection pool fix) ──────────────────────────────
// ONE EventSource for the whole SPA, fanned out client-side to every
// subscriber — the same shape as the mock's emitTopic fan-out. The old
// one-EventSource-per-subscriber design exhausted Chromium's 6-connections-
// per-host pool (App badge + useMembers + useMonitoring + useChat already held
// 4; each mounted inline ChatReplyCard added one more), after which EVERY
// fetch — the reply POST included — hung forever. Pinned by
// e2e_test/tests/13_reply_cards.spec.js (雙卡同房 leg).
//
// Lifecycle: the connection opens lazily on the first subscriber and is CLOSED
// when the last subscriber unsubscribes. Why close (not keep-alive):
//   1. In practice the set never empties while the SPA is up (the App shell's
//      badge hook subscribes for the app's lifetime), so this path only fires
//      on full teardown/logout — exactly when the connection should go away.
//   2. Reopening re-reads ownerToken(), so a re-login gets a fresh token
//      instead of a connection pinned to a stale JWT.
//   3. Server-side presence projects "online" from live SSE connections; a
//      subscriber-less phantom connection would misrepresent liveness.
// Reconnect: unchanged — the browser's native EventSource auto-retry still
// applies to the (single) connection; we never tear it down on transient
// errors, only on last-unsubscribe.
