// api_tasks.go — the M3 task surface: the shared read face (owner cockpit +
// agents), the owner actions (terminate / priority / task-card message), and
// the agent write face (create with dedupe, plan, the agent-reported state
// machine, gate arming, deps, the outsource worker's claim).
//
// Contract spine (M3 contract §B–§D):
//   * work progress is REPORTED by the executing agent; the server VALIDATES
//     transitions (illegal → 409) and never finishes the work for the agent —
//     it does not auto-advance a task FORWARD (in_progress → done is the
//     agent's alone). This is the surviving half of the old H4 ruling;
//   * waiting_owner is a card-lifecycle HOLD, bracketed entirely by the card:
//     it is ENTERED only by opening a card — open_gate (which IS an M2 reply
//     card, same machinery plus the task/step linkage) or a plain
//     create_reply_card auto-bound to the current step (inferCardTaskStep +
//     armStepWithCard) — and LEFT only when that card is answered, where the
//     server itself restores the task/step to in_progress
//     (releaseCardHold). The agent reports NEITHER side: a
//     report INTO waiting_owner is a 400 (not its lever), a report OUT of it a
//     409 (the answer drives the exit). This supersedes H4's "answering moves
//     nothing" — a task can no longer linger in waiting_owner behind an
//     already-answered card (T-68b7);
//   * done/terminated are terminal: closed_ts stamps, bound outsource
//     workers release, and every later agent push is a flat 409;
//   * create dedupes on (type_key, manual-derived dedupe_key) against
//     NON-terminal tasks only: a hit answers 200 + the existing task +
//     deduped:true (H1/H2 — dedupe is the normal path, never an error).

// mirrored in server/CLAUDE.md:
//
//		「如果是有手冊的話看手冊上指定的,如果是自由指派那種不是由手冊來的,但是發派
//		 對象是外包的話,那就以該 agent 本身配置一樣下去開外包。」
//
//	  - HAS A MANUAL (typed) → the type manual's outsource assignee. The 手冊 is
//	    the owner-authored configuration for that whole task type, so whichever
//	    member happened to press 發包 must not silently override it.
//	  - NO MANUAL (ad-hoc/free), dispatched to outsource → the DISPATCHING agent's
//	    own spec: the runtime, model and effort it runs as, and the machine it is
//	    itself pinned to. 發包 without a spec means "one like me". (Independently
//	    stated in T-0d32: 自由代辦外包完整繼承委派者設定.)
//
// The two passes below ARE those two cases: manualSpec is non-nil only when the
// task carries a type_key whose manual exists AND routes to outsource
// (outsourceSpecOf returns nil otherwise), so the dispatcher pass decides
// anything only where there was no manual to read — or (T-8a67) where the manual
// read did not state the field at all. Read that way the order is still not a
// tie-break between rivals: a field the 手冊 named is already filled when the
// dispatcher pass runs, so they never compete for one.
//
// T-8a67 added that second half deliberately. Before it, a typed 發包 whose
// manual assignee named no machine resolved to no machine AT ALL, and since
// nothing else invents one, the worker minted for that task was unbootable for
// life. "The 手冊 decides" was never meant to include the fields the 手冊 left
// blank — silence is not a decision.
//
// ⚠️ Reading it AS a priority order is what went wrong once already: fb8981c set
// out to make an ad-hoc dispatch inherit the dispatcher — which this code
// ALREADY did — and expressed it as a global inversion, which changed nothing
// for ad-hoc and broke every typed dispatch, leaving two tests red. If you are
// about to "fix" one arm, check whether it is already correct in the other's
// absence, and pin the two arms separately (the tests do).
//
// runtime and model inherit TOGETHER: a model name only means anything under the
// runtime it was chosen for, so an inherited model is kept only when its source's
// runtime is the runtime actually being dispatched. Otherwise the model is left
// empty and the runtime's own default model applies — mixing a codex model into a
// claude boot would be a spawn failure the owner never asked for.
//
// Nothing here invents a machine. When neither the target, the manual, nor the
// dispatcher names one, Machine stays empty — and an empty machine is not a
// destination (pickWorkerWarden fails closed with a visible reason). That is the
// point: a placement nobody chose is not a placement.
//
// That rule and the dispatcher fall-through above are NOT in tension, and the
// owner settled it explicitly (2026-07-26, reading A — single authoritative
// statement in server/CLAUDE.md §8, do not re-derive it from the two separate
// rulings): a blank machine field on a manual assignee STATES NOTHING (it is not
// "deliberately unplaced"), so falling through to the creator's own pin is
// allowed — that pin is itself an explicit human placement decision somebody
// already made for that agent. What stays forbidden is the SERVER picking a host
// on its own. When truly nobody has named one — the creator has no pin either —
// Machine is still left empty and the worker is still not booted.
//
// ⚠️ KNOWN LIMITATION — T-8a67's snapshot fixes CLAUDE creators only (T-cd21 holds
// the real fix; do not read the paragraphs above as covering this). On a TYPED
// manual-driven task, runtime and effort can never reach the dispatcher pass:
// outsourceSpecOf fills Runtime=claude / Effort=medium BEFORE it reads a single
// assignee key, so the manual's silence is indistinguishable from it saying
// "claude", and only Model and Machine are ever actually snapshotted. For a CODEX
// creator that combination is incoherent by construction: Runtime is forced to
// claude, the coupling rule above then correctly drops the creator's codex Model
// — but the Machine arm has no such coupling, so the creator's CODEX box is still
// snapshotted. resolveWorkerPlacement then refuses it (machineSupportsRuntime:
// a reported capability map that does not mention claude means absent, not
// unknown), and the worker stalls with `machine_unavailable: machine 'X' does not
// provide the 'claude' runtime`.
//
// So for a codex creator this ticket's symptom is NOT fixed, only re-coded: the
// worker still never boots, it merely says machine_unavailable instead of
// no_machine_selected. Not a regression (that spawn failed before too), and
// pinned by TestCreateTypedManualDrivenCodexCreatorStillFailsClosed so the gap
// cannot quietly disappear from the record. Whether it fails or boots as a claude
// worker on a codex dev's box depends on what that machine REPORTED: a host with
// no capability map, or one that lists claude too, boots — still not "one like
// me", just not refused.
