// the retired Python service/routes.py: routing is a TABLE, never an if-chain. Every
// served route is one RouteSpec row (method + path + handler + auth label +
// the MINIMUM principal class it admits + the MCP-surface flags); the mux is
// built FROM the table and the boot assertions run OVER the table.
//
// M3 REST sub-batch A: the table now carries the FULL wire surface (every
// operation of spec/openapi.json, auth/requires/mcp flags mirrored row-for-row
// from service/routes.py ROUTE_SPECS). Handlers come THROUGH the generated
// ServerInterfaceWrapper (ocapi_gen.go) over apiServer (api_stub.go): the four
// build-identity probes are real, everything else answers an honest 501 until
// sub-batch B fills the method bodies — adding behaviour never touches this
// table again.
