// outsource_sched.go — the M3 Phase 2 outsource-assignment scheduler, the
// second background producer (isomorphic to reconcile.go — contract §B.4):
//
//   * outsourceDecide — the PURE admission core (the reconcileDecide twin):
//     (queue snapshot, per-type manual specs, live worker counts, the global
//     cap) → the ordered assignment list. All IO lives in runOutsourceTick.
//   * the 30s cadence tick (startOutsourceCadence) + the event-driven single
//     tick (outsourceTickNow — fired when create_task lands an outsource
//     task, so an assignment never waits a full period).
//   * --no-outsource (serve flag) disables the producer WHOLESALE — cadence
//     AND the event-driven tick — the --no-reconcile mirror: a shadow server
//     must never mint workers against the production queue.
//
// Admission (contract §B.4, owner rulings ③/H6/H7):
//   * candidates: status='not_started' ∧ executor_kind='outsource' ∧
//     executor_id='' ∧ priority≠'frozen', ordered high→mid→low then
//     created_ts (FIFO within a priority band);
//   * per-type cap: the manual assignee's copies — at most N live
//     (assigned+active) workers of that type (H6: N parallel TASKS, the
//     one-worker-one-task model holds);
//   * global cap: task.outsource_max_parallel over ALL live workers
//     (0 = assignment paused; member tasks never count — H7).
//
// An assignment mints the worker as a kind='outsource' MEMBER row (A案 P7d
// fold — 外包＝正職; codename via the domain derivation over EVERY codename the
// member table has ever carried, removed rows included, so a codename is never
// reused; model/effort from the manual assignee), writes task.executor_id, and
// fans the task + outsource_worker SSE deltas. The worker then sits in
// 'assigned' until its first GET /api/self/task claim flips it 'active'.
//
// The scheduler keeps NO in-memory ledger (unlike reconcile's store): the
// worker rows ARE the bookkeeping — every tick recounts from the DB, so a
// restart forgets nothing and the cadence is an idempotent backstop of the
// event-driven tick (a task with executor_id set simply stops matching).
