	// and it happens to be the SAME number he set for the cap on a duty

	// 1000」. ⚠️ Same origin, TWO INDEPENDENT VALUES: this one is a compiled

	// 🔴 "DOES THIS CAP EVER BIND" HAS BEEN ANSWERED BOTH WAYS HERE, AND
	// NEITHER ANSWER IS A PROPERTY OF THIS CONSTANT — read this before you
	// rely on either. An earlier version of this comment called this cap "a
	// safety net that normally does not fire", and 61291d3 (2026-08-03)
	// deleted that reading as FALSE — false at the time it was written, not
	// merely overtaken later. Each of the two readings below describes only
	// the role definitions of one period; neither is a standing fact:
	//   - 2026-08-03, BEFORE the insight/operating-manual separation landed:
	//     duties still carried their manual material and the cap bound for
	//     almost every role. "Rarely fires" was a LIE on the day it was
	//     written, and the code ran permanently in the regime that phrase
	//     called exceptional.
	//     The char counts that reading was argued with are deliberately NOT
	//     restated here. The set inherited from that era contradicts itself:
	//     a longest role of 9,112 cannot fit inside "nine roles totalling
	//     ~7–8k", and neither figure agrees with the 35–4,594 range quoted
	//     alongside them. When numbers from one source disagree among
	//     themselves, the whole set goes — there is no way to tell which half
	//     happens to be true, and the most plausible-looking figure is the
	//     most dangerous one to keep. That measurement is in the past and
	//     cannot be retaken from this repo, so the counts are simply not
	//     stated; the qualitative fact above is the part this argument rests
	//     on and the part that survives.
	//   - 2026-08-04, AFTER the separation landed: a runtime `list_roles`
	//     reading of ONE instance saw 8 roles, longest 455 chars, none over
	//     the cap. So "rarely binds" was true as of that 2026-08-04
	//     measurement — a reading taken on a date, not a property of this
	//     constant, and nothing in this repo re-checks it or can re-derive it.
	// The ONLY thing that moved it between the two is that the separation
	// landed. If you are about to depend on "it rarely binds", MEASURE IT
	// AGAIN: both of the readings above were at some point written into this
	// file as if they were standing properties of the cap, and both had to be
	// corrected afterwards.
	//
	// 🔴 Do not take "it rarely fires now" as licence to lower it. That cost
	// was put to the owner WITH the numbers in rc-d88c445397a3 (an
	// independent review argued for 150–200 until the separation lands), and
	// he ruled ②: keep 1000. It is his number — do not lower it here.

//     first section heading — it is syntactically a title line. The content
