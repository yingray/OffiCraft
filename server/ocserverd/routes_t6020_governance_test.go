// routes_t6020_governance_test.go — the two teeth of the owner's 2026-07-26
// governance ruling, held at the ROUTE TABLE (the conformance suite holds the
// same two facts over the live wire; this is the cheap lane that reddens in
// seconds).
//
// The ruling has two halves and neither is self-enforcing:
//
//	(a) 19 operational routes moved from requires=owner + mcp_exclude down to
//	    requires=admin_agent + a real MCP tool. Left unpinned this rots into
//	    "the tool has a name but the choke still refuses", or into a row
//	    silently drifting back to owner during an unrelated edit — and every
//	    other test in the package would stay green through both.
//
//	(b) Owner-only routes were deliberately NOT opened. That is the half most likely to
//	    be undone by a well-meaning future edit ("these look like they were
//	    missed"), which is exactly why routes.go carries the reason per row and
//	    why this file refuses the change.

// TestT6020OpenedToolsCarryTheirWholeParameterSet is the field-level tooth for

// descriptor missing a parameter is the DEFAULT outcome of adding one by hand,
// not an exotic failure: the tool would list, resolve, and answer — and Mira
