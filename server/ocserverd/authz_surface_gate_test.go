// authz_surface_gate_test.go — T-5336's structural node: a gate over the SHAPE
// that keeps producing these tickets, not over the one rule that was wrong.
//
// THE SHAPE. T-6020 (owner 2026-07-26) re-graded 24 operational endpoints in one
// pass. It could only see what it could enumerate, and what it enumerated was
// the ROUTE TABLE's `Requires` column. Authorization that lives ANYWHERE ELSE —
// a hard test inside a handler, or a write verb parked at the machine floor and
// guarded by nothing at all — was structurally invisible to that pass. The
// webhook CRUD rows this ticket fixed were exactly that: four write/read rows at
// `principalMachine`, whose only apparent protection (`MCPExclude`) was not an
// authz mechanism at all. So the defect is not "one rule was set wrong", it is
// "authz outside the route table does not get re-graded when the table does".
//
// This file is the enumeration T-6020 did not have. Two gates:
//
//	(1) TestAuthzOutsideTheRouteTableIsEnumerated — every caller-classification
//	    predicate in request-visible code must be listed here WITH A REASON. A
//	    new one is a build-time conversation, not a silent addition.
//	(2) TestMachineFloorWriteRoutesAreEachARuling — every WRITE verb declared at
//	    the machine floor must carry a ruling reference. Parking a mutating route
//	    at the floor is now an act someone signed for.
//
// ── WHY IT IS NOT ONE OF THE THREE USELESS GATES ────────────────────────────
//
// NOT TAUTOLOGICAL. Both gates were mutation-tested by hand (2026-07-27):
//   - adding one in-handler hard authz check (`currentScope(r) == "agent"` +
//     403 in HandleUpdateMemberApiMembersMemberIdPatch) → gate (1) RED;
//   - demoting one write route (`DELETE /api/members/{member_id}`) from
//     admin_agent back to principalMachine → gate (2) RED.
//     Both restored from a scratchpad copy afterwards, with the transcript in
//     the T-5336 report.
//
// NOT "MATCHES ITS OWN COMMENT". The scan is an AST walk (go/parser), not a
// text grep: comments and string literals are not expression nodes, so no prose
// in this file — or any other — can be mistaken for a predicate. This very file
// is also skipped by construction (_test.go files are never scanned).
//
// NOT "ASSERT EMPTY, THEN RANGE OVER THE EMPTY SET". This repo has shipped that
// bug before, so each gate proves its own corpus is populated BEFORE judging it:
// gate (1) fails if fewer files/functions/predicates than a floor were seen, and
// fails on a STALE inventory entry; gate (2) fails if the route table has no
// write rows or no machine-floor rows at all. A scanner that silently stops
// matching reddens. (This is the antidote for THESE TWO GATES only — it says
// nothing about that bug class elsewhere in the repo.)
//
// ⚠️ WHAT THESE GATES DO NOT DO — read this before trusting an entry. They
// cannot judge whether a reason is HONEST. A correctly-keyed entry with a
// plausible-sounding sentence ("legacy behaviour retained for backwards
// compatibility, revisit later") passes both gates; the length checks stop a
// one-word shrug, not a fluent one. Verified by the T-5336 review, which did
// exactly that and got two green gates.
//
// So the value of these lists is NOT that they cannot be padded — they can.
// It is that PADDING MUST SHOW UP IN THE DIFF: adding a decision outside the
// route table now requires editing this file, in the same commit, where a
// reviewer sees it. The gate converts a silent addition into a visible one.
// The only thing that stops a bad entry is a human reading the diff, so read
// new entries here as claims to check, not as decisions already approved.
